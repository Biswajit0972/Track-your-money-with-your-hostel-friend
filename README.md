### **Track Your Expenses with Your Hostel Friend â€“ Smart Expense Sharing**  

Managing expenses with hostel friends can be tricky, but with smart logic, you can **track, split, and settle payments efficiently**.  

#### **How It Works:**  
1. **Loan & Payment Tracking**  
   - If you **lend** money to a friend, it adds to their balance.  
   - If you **borrow**, your balance updates accordingly.  

2. **Automated Balance Adjustments**  
   - When a **friend repays**, their balance reduces.  
   - If a **loan limit is exceeded**, an alert prevents overpayment.  

3. **Seamless Splitting**  
   - Expenses are shared based on contributions.  
   - The system **calculates remaining dues** and adjusts balances.  

4. **Real-time Updates**  
   - Each transaction is dispatched to the state, ensuring accuracy.  
   - No direct mutationsâ€”**ensuring data consistency and reactivity**.  

With this logic, managing **shared expenses in a hostel** becomes hassle-free, preventing conflicts and keeping finances transparent! ðŸš€
